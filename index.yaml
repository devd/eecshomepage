  ABSTRACT: "Application platforms provide third-party applications with access
  to hardware (e.g., GPS and cameras) and personal data. Many platforms use
  permission systems to protect access to these resources. The nature of these
  permission systems vary widely across platforms. Some platforms obtain user
  consent as part of installation, while others display runtime consent
  dialogs. We propose a set of guidelines to aid platform designers in
  determining the most appropriate permission-granting mechanism for a given
  permission. We apply our proposal to a smartphone platform. A preliminary
  evaluation indicates that our model will reduce the number of warnings
  presented to users, thereby reducing habituation effects."

  ABSTRACT: "The standard approach for privilege separation in web applications is to
  execute application components in different web origins. This limits the
  practicality of privilege separation since each web origin has financial and
  administrative cost. In this paper, we propose a new design for achieving
  effective privilege separation in HTML5 applications that shows how
  applications can cheaply create arbitrary number of components. Our approach
  utilizes standardized abstractions already implemented in modern browsers. We
  do not advocate any changes to the underlying browser or require learning new
  high-level languages, which contrasts prior approaches. We empirically show
  that we can retrofit our design to real-world HTML5 applications (browser
  extensions and rich client-side applications) and achieve reduction of 6x
  to  10000x in TCB for our case studies. Our mechanism requires less than 13
  lines of application-specific code changes and considerably improves
  auditability.

  ABSTRACT: "Mobile application markets thrive, yet they are heldback 
    from their full potential by the information asymmetrybetween application
    developers and application consumers. AConsumer has no way to gauge
    the security or reliability of anapplication, and a developer has
    no way to differentiate hisapplication from that of the competition
    on the basis of thesefactors. We argue that the centralized nature
    of mobileapplication markets, such as Android Market and the iOS
    App Store,afford them a unique opportunity to gather and present
    information. We discuss a number of ideas to leverage thisopportunity
    to eliminate information asymmetry, includingthirdparty certifications,
    qualitative descriptions of attacksurface, and aggregated usage
    data."

  ABSTRACT: "While most research on XSS defense has focused on techniques for
  securing existing applications and re-architecting browser mechanisms,
  sanitization remains the industry-standard defense mechanism. By streamlining
  and automating XSS sanitization, web application frameworks stand in a good
  position to stop XSS but have received little research attention. In order to
  drive research on web frameworks, we systematically study the security of the
  XSS sanitization abstractions frameworks provide. We develop a novel model of
  the web browser and characterize the challenges of XSS sanitization. Based on
  the model, we systematically evaluate the XSS abstractions in 14 major
  commercially-used web frameworks. We find that frameworks often do not
  address critical parts of the XSS conundrum. We perform an empirical analysis
  of 8 large web applications to extract the requirements of sanitization
  primitives from the perspective of real-world applications. Our study shows
  that there is a wide gap between the abstractions provided by frameworks and
  the requirements of applications."

  ABSTRACT: "We propose a formal model of web security based on an abstraction
  of the web platform and use this model to analyze the security of several
  sample web mechanisms and applications. We identify multiple distinct threat
  models that can be used to analyze web applications, ranging from a web
  attacker who controls malicious web sites and clients, to stronger attackers
  who can control the network and/or leverage sites designed to display
  user-supplied content. We propose two broadly applicable security goals and
  study five security mechanisms. In our case studies, which include HTML5
  forms, Referer validation, and a single sign-on solution, we use a SAT-based
  model-checking tool to fid two previously known vulnerabilities and three new
  vulnerabilities. The case study of a Kerberos-based single sign-on system
  illustrates key differences between network protocols and web protocols and
  finds a vulnerability that arises because of the way cookies, redirects, and
  embedded links are used."

  ABSTRACT: "As AJAX applications gain popularity, client-side JavaScript code
  is becoming increasingly complex. However, few automated vulnerability
  analysis tools for JavaScript exist. In this paper, we describe the first
  system for exploring the execution space of JavaScript code using symbolic
  execution. To handle JavaScript code’s complex use of string operations, we
  design a new language of string constraints and implement a solver for it. We
  build an automatic end-to-end tool, Kudzu, and apply it to the problem of
  finding client-side code injection vulnerabilities. In experiments on 18 live
  web applications, Kudzu automatically discovers 2 previously unknown
  vulnerabilities and 9 more than that were previously found only with a
  manually-constructed test suite."

  ABSTRACT: "Several new browser primitives have been
  proposed to meet the demands of application interactivity while enabling
  security. To investigate whether applications consistently use these
  primitives safely and adequately in practice, we study the real-world usage
  of two client-side primitives, namely postMessage and HTML5’s client-side
  database storage. We examine new purely client-side communication protocols
  layered on postMessage (Facebook Connect, Google Friend Connect) and several
  real-world web applications (including Gmail, Buzz, Maps and others) which
  use client-side storage abstractions. We find that, in practice, these
  abstractions are widely used insecurely, which leads to severe
  vulnerabilities and can increase the attack surface for web applications in
  unexpected ways. We conclude the paper by offering insights into why these
  abstractions can be hard to use safely, and propose the economy of
  liabilities principle for designing future abstractions. The principle
  recommends that a good design for a primitive should minimize the liability
  that the user undertakes to ensure application security. We suggest
  enhancements to the existing browser primitives to make their secure use more
  practical."
